# google-communities-lister
Lists some of the google communities that are active in Turkey. This repo was created as my final submission to the 2020 Google Developer MultiCamp
### Used Plugins
kotlin-android-extensions //< used for synthetic, I would normally use the recommended practice (view binding), but I chose to do it similarly to how it was on course materials

### The following and more were used to realize this submission;
* Retrofit
* kotlinx-serialization-core
* kotlinx-serialization-converter
* kotlinx-coroutines //< so that we can do things asynchronously (~multithreading)
* lifecycle
* coil //< to show images from urls easily.
